        <p>Water pollutants come from either point sources or dispersed sources. A point source is a pipe or channel, such as those used for discharge from an industrial facility or a city sewerage system. A dispersed (or nonpoint) source is a very broad unconfined area from which a variety of pollutants enter the water body, such as the runoff from an agricultural area. Point sources of water pollution are easier to control than dispersed sources, because the contaminated water has been collected and conveyed to one single point where it can be treated. Pollution from dispersed sources is difficult to control, and, despite much progress in the building of modern sewage-treatment plants, dispersed sources continue to cause a large fraction of water pollution problems.</p>

        <p>Soil pollution is defined as the presence of toxic chemicals (pollutants or contaminants) in the soil, in very high concentrations to pose a risk to human health and the ecosystem. Or in simple words Alteration in the natural soil due to human activities is termed Soil Pollution. For example, exposure to soil containing high concentrations of benzene can increase the risk of soil pollution diseases like contracting leukemia.All the soils contain compounds that are harmful to human beings and other living organisms. However, the concentration of such substances in unpolluted soil is so low that they do not pose any threat to the surroundings but when the concentration of such toxic substances becomes high enough to cause damage to living organisms, the soil is said to be contaminated.</p>

        <p>These are mostly linked to the combustion of several kinds of fuel.

            Immobile sources entail clouds of smoke from power plants, industrial facilities (manufacturing works) and waste furnaces, as well as incinerators and other sorts of fuel-burning heating devices. In poor and developing countries, archaic biomass burning is the chief cause of air pollution; traditional biomass embraces wood, crop leftovers and excrement.
            
            Movable sources comprise automobiles, aquatic vessels, and planes.
            
            Controlled burning is a procedure sometimes used in forest management, agriculture, prairie re-establishment. Fire is an accepted facet of both forest and grassland ecosystem and an organized fire can be an instrument for foresters. Precise burning kindles the sprouting of some desirable trees, thus renewing the forest.
            
            Fumes from hair spray, paint, aerosol sprays, varnish and other solvents
            
            Waste deposits in landfills create methane. Methane is extremely combustible and may form an explosive and volatile concoction with air. Methane is furthermore an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in a sealed-off space. Suffocation may result if the oxygen concentration goes below 19.5% by displacement.
